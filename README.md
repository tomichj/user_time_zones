# UserTimeZones

UserTimeZones provides an easyway to work with multiple user time zones.

UserTimeZones is intended to be small, simple, and well-tested. A large percentage of applications will require
support for per-user time zones which this gem can assist with. The solution is simple; you could implement it 
yourself, but this library will let you implement the solution the same way, every time, without having 
to expend excess effort. 

## Requirements

* Ruby on Rails 5
* a user model (`User` by default, but any class name is supported)
* a `current_user` helper

## Install

To get started, add the UserTimeZones gem to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install` to install it:

```ruby
gem 'user_time_zones'
```

Run the install generator:
```sh
rails generate user_time_zones:install
```

Apply the migration the generator created:
```sh
rails db:migrate
```

The install generator will:
* Create a migration that adds a `time_zone` column to your user table.
* Insert `include UserTimeZones::User` into your `User` model.
* Insert `include UserTimeZones::Controller` into your `ApplicationController`.

You may optionally include the javascript to guess a new user's timezone in your `application.js`:
```javascript
//= require user_time_zones
```


##### Different user model?

To specify an alternate user model (something other than `User`), use the --model flag. For example, if your user model
is named `Profile`:

```sh
rails generate user_time_zones:install --model Profile
```


## Use

UserTimeZones has two use cases:
* calculate the user's time zone when creating a user account
* apply the user's time zone for the duration of a controller action

### Calculate the time zone offset for new users

Include the UserTimeZones javascript in your `application.js` and use the form helper `guess_tz_offset_field` to
generate a hidden field, `:time_zone_offset`. The included javascript will set `:time_zone_offset` to the user's 
time zone offset.

A `guess_tz_offset_field_tag` helper is also included.

Example form for a new user that includes the `time_zone_offset`:
```erbruby
<%= form_for @user, method: :post do |f| %>
    <%= f.guess_tz_offset_field %>
    <%= f.text_field :first_name %>
    # ...
<% end %>
```

The javascript will calculate the time zone offset, e.g. -9, and set it as a value for the `time_zone_offset` field.
The javascript looks for any element with the attribute `data-behavior="guess-time-zone-offset"`.

Your user controller will need to permit attribute `:time_zone_offset`.


##### Why guess the time zone?

You could ask your new user to pick their time zone from a drop-down during sign-up. That works. But reducing
the complexity of sign-up almost always increases user conversion rate. By determining the user's time zone 
offset and making a guess at their timezone, that's one less thing you have to require from your user at sign up.

You can allow the user to edit their time zone later on, in user#edit or elsewhere.


### Applying the user's time zone

For each action a user takes, UserTimeZones will set the time zone to a user's `:time_zone` . 
This is done in `ApplcationController` with an `around_action` that calls `Time.use_zone`.


### The User model and time zones

UserTimeZones gives the user a new attribute, `time_zone`, and new methods `time_zone_offset` and `time_zone_offset=`. 
The `time_zone` user attribute is the name of a `ActiveSupport::TimeZone`. The offset methods are the offset of 
the time zone from `UTC`, in hours.

Example:
```ruby
>> user.time_zone_offset = -8
=> -8
>> user.time_zone
=> "Pacific Time (US & Canada)"
>> user.time_zone = "Alaska"
=> "Alaska"
>> user.time_zone_offset
=> -9
```


### A summary of do’s and don'ts with time zones

Some methods are a lot more time zone friendly than others.
     
     DON’T USE
     * Time.now
     * Date.today
     * Date.today.to_time
     * Time.parse("2015-07-04 17:05:37")
     * Time.strptime(string, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")
     
     DO USE
     * Time.current
     * 2.hours.ago
     * Time.zone.today
     * Date.current
     * 1.day.from_now
     * Time.zone.parse("2015-07-04 17:05:37")
     * Time.strptime(string, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z").in_time_zone
